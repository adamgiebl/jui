# Example App

An example application built with jui. The UI resembles Webstorm, and has a very limited editing/vcs functionality.
But it's important to note that it's by no means an effort for implementing a real IDE!

It's available as:

- A story on the storybook (mostly for easy development).
- A page on the website, served as a full demo.
- A standalone app.

[//]: # "TODO: highlight the differences of standalone build and storybook/website."

### Running in storybook or website

### Running standalone
