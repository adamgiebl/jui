 * Can be provided by the overlay where the menu is rendered in. If provided, menu will call the provided close function

 * for keeping the menu overlay open after a menu item is selected.
 * **Update**: there are use cases where the menu is not closed after an item is clicked. Most of the toggle-able
 * actions (the ones with a checkmark) seem to be like this.
 * TODO: Make "close on selection" more flexible. Some ideas:
 *  - instead of calling close, pass it to `onAction` handler. Then on each action, one would need to call close if
 *    needed.
 *  - Offer a `MenuItem` component to be used instead of generic `Item`, where it accepts `closeOnSelect` boolean, which
 *    is true by default.
 *  - pass a `keepOpen` function to `onAction`.
 *  - Allow signaling whether the menu should kept open, via the returned value of onAction. e.g. return false means keep open.
 *  Last two suggestions are based on the assumption that most of the menu items are not selectable.
 *  Note that MenuOverlayContext could be used directly in action handlers too, but baking it into the menu makes it
 *  much more convenient, which seems more important than breaking the nice separation between Menu and MenuTrigger.

/**
 * UI for menus which are normally shown in a popover. Being rendered as an overlay is not handled here.
 * Also there is no coupling with any higher level entity like "Action", since this is just for the UI layer.
 * Something like ActionMenu which creates a menu out of a list of actions can be implemented on top of this.
 *
 * @example
 *  <Menu>
 *    <Item>Item one</Item>
 *    <Item>
 *      <MenuItemLayout
 *        icon={<PlatformIcon icon={"actions/copy"} />}
 *        content="Copy"
 *        shortcut={"âŒ˜C"} />
 *    </Item>
 *  </Menu>
 *
 *  Current issues and limitations:
 *  - Divider in sub-menu's is not supported. because of a constraint in @react-stately/collections, which results in
 *    this error: Unsupported type <Divider> in <Item>. Only <Item> is supported. Maybe supporting section would
 *    be a workaround for it.
 *  - when a parent menu item which has an open submenu is hovered, it gets focus.
 *
 *  TODO:
 *  - [Least important] pass aria props to icon, keyboard shortcut, and content part of menu item. Maybe a context
 *    can be provided for it from menu item, which also exposes state like selected.
