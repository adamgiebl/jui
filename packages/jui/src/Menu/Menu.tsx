 * UI for menus which are normally shown in a popover. Being rendered as an overlay is not handled here.
 * Also there is no coupling with any higher level entity like "Action", since this is just for the UI layer.
 * Something like ActionMenu which creates a menu out of a list of actions can be implemented on top of this.
 *
 * @example
 *  <Menu>
 *    <Item>Item one</Item>
 *    <Item>
 *      <MenuItemLayout
 *        icon={<PlatformIcon icon={"actions/copy"} />}
 *        content="Copy"
 *        shortcut={"âŒ˜C"} />
 *    </Item>
 *  </Menu>
 *
 *  Current issues and limitations:
 *  - Divider in sub-menu's is not supported. because of a constraint in @react-stately/collections, which results in
 *    this error: Unsupported type <Divider> in <Item>. Only <Item> is supported. Maybe supporting section would
 *    be a workaround for it.
 *  - when a parent menu item which has an open submenu is hovered, it gets focus.
 *
 *  TODO:
 *  - [Least important] pass aria props to icon, keyboard shortcut, and content part of menu item. Maybe a context
 *    can be provided for it from menu item, which also exposes state like selected.
