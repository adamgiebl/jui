// NOTE: some stuff like `useCollectionCacheInvalidation` are not exported from the index, since the index is re-exported
// from other modules like Menu, Tabs, etc., but that part of the API is not considered a public API at the moment.
// Those stuff are intentionally imported by relative path to Collections folder ATM.
