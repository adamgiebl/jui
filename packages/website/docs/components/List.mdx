# List

Used for showing a flat list of items with different selection modes. It's usually used in master-detail views, or for
a list of items with a single attribute. Here is some examples from JetBrains IDEs:

- **Settings -> Tools -> SSH Configurations** (master-detail)
- **Settings -> Appearance & Behavior -> Scopes** (master-detail)
- **Settings -> Editor -> General -> Console -> Exceptions** (single attribute list of items)
- **Settings -> Editor -> File and Code Templates** (master-detail)
- **Settings -> Editor -> Natural Languages** (single attribute list of items)
- **Show Local History** window (advanced layout)
