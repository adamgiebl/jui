# Link

[Link component](https://jetbrains.github.io/ui/controls/link/) implementation. It uses a focusable interactive span
with necessary a11y attributes, and supports disabled state.

#### Remaining features

- [ ] `preventFocusOnPress`
- [ ] Support for using normal html anchor link. At least external link is a use case.
- [ ] Support for icon at left and right. A few specific icons like "externalLink", "ContextHelp", or "DropdownLink"
      are supported in [`ActionLink` implementation](https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-community/blob/82f201386c3f7a339ff25fc8f3389024c8078a87/platform/platform-api/src/com/intellij/ui/components/ActionLink.kt#L60-L63)

### Live example

```jsx live themed
<>
  <Link onPress={console.log}>Configure servers...</Link> <br />
  <Link onPress={console.log} isDisabled>
