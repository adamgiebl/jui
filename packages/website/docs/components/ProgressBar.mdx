# ProgressBar

[ProgressBar](https://jetbrains.github.io/ui/controls/progress_bar/) component, for showing a simple progress bar, or
a [ProgressPanel](https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-community/blob/82f201386c3f7a339ff25fc8f3389024c8078a87/platform/platform-api/src/com/intellij/openapi/ui/panel/ProgressPanel.java#L28),
consisted of a progress bar, a label, details, and control buttons.

### Features

- Showing [process name](https://jetbrains.github.io/ui/controls/progress_bar/#process-name) and
  [details](https://jetbrains.github.io/ui/controls/progress_bar/#process-details).
- [Indeterminate](https://jetbrains.github.io/ui/controls/progress_bar/#04)
- Value label for [showing percentage when space is limited](https://jetbrains.github.io/ui/controls/progress_bar/#13)
- [Pause, resume and cancel buttons](https://jetbrains.github.io/ui/controls/progress_bar/#process-control).

### Known issues

There are a couple of UI issues because of the current layout (which can be improved probably):

- max-width of the label and details, it's not necessarily aligned with the the progressbar track, because they don't
  share the same container
- when label is on the side, details is aligned with the label, instead of the progressbar track.

### Live example

```jsx live themed
<>
  <ProgressBar value={20} /> <br />
  <ProgressBar isIndeterminate name="Indeterminate" /> <br />
  <ProgressBar
    value={40}
    name="With name, details and controls"
    details="10 files of 256 files - About 10 minutes left"
    button={
      <>
        <ProgressBarPauseButton
          paused={false} /* try changing this to true */
        />
        {/* <ProgressBarStopButton /> */}
      </>
    }
  />
  <br />
  <ProgressBar value={70} name="Name on side:" namePosition="side" /> <br />
  <br />
  <ProgressBar
    value={70}
    name="With value label:"
    namePosition="side"
    showValueLabel
  />
  <br />
  <ProgressBar value={25} name="In dialog" button={<Button>Cancel</Button>} />
  <br />
</>
```
