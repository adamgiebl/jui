# Balloon

A component for a single [Balloon notification](https://jetbrains.github.io/ui/controls/balloon/).

:::note Note
How balloon notifications are stacked and positioned in bottom right, and an imperative API for triggering notifications
is outside the scope of what this component is about.
:::

### Features

- Default and custom icon types
- `title`, `body`, `actions`. `body` is expandable/collapsible if there is overflow. It can be 1, 2 or three lines in
  collapsed mode, based on existence of `title` and `actions`.
- Close button in the header (if onClose is passed), as well as custom icon(s), like a settings icon.

#### Remaining

- [ ] `BalloonActions` component for rendering actions links where
      [non-fitting ones are moved into a dropdown](https://jetbrains.github.io/ui/controls/balloon/#19).
- [ ] A provider component that exposes a hook as an imperative API for triggering notifications (w/o timeout) and
      renders the stack of notifications.

- [ ] Support for error style notification (used for IDE errors)

  <img src={imgSrc} width="370" />

### Live example

```jsx live themed
<>
  <Balloon
    icon="Info" // try "Error" or "Warning"
    title="Maven Projects need to be imported"
    body="Projects to be imported: MavenSync, MavenDependencies. Maven project structure has been changed. Import changes to IntelliJ IDEA project to make it work correctly."
    actions={
      <>
        <Link>Import changes</Link>
        <Link>Enable auto-import</Link>
      </>
    }
    onClose={console.log}
    headerActions={
      <AutoHoverPlatformIcon icon="ide/notification/gear" role="button" />
    }
  />
</>
```

### Expanded

Body becomes expandable only if the content doesn't fit within the allowed number of lines. The expanded state can
[optionally be controlled](https://medium.com/quick-code/writing-ui-components-with-optionally-controllable-state-86e396a6f1ec).

```jsx live themed
<>
  <Balloon
    body="Projects to be imported: MavenSync, MavenDependencies. Maven project structure has been changed. Import changes to IntelliJ IDEA project to make it work correctly."
    //     expanded
  />
</>
```
