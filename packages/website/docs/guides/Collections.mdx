# Collections

A good number of components like List, Tree, Menu, Tabs, etc. display a collection of items.
[@react-stately/collections](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-stately/collections.html) is used for all of them
to provide a uniform and flexible API that would allow for both static jsx-based or dynamic source of items.

## Rendering optimization caveat

When the API for dynamic items (`items` prop and a render function as `children`) is used, the render result for each
item [is subject to caching](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-stately/collections.html#why-not-array-map) based
on the item object. It's important to understand this assumption that the rendering should only depend on the item, and
not any other piece of state from the closure, for example.

:::info
Item renderer function is assumed to be a pure function that depends only on its single argument, the item
object.
:::

In some cases however, there might be a need to render some UI based on a something other than the item object itself.
Below is a few ways to do that.

### Using context

TODO (important point: especially useful for components that implement virtual rendering, as only a limited number of
items are mounted at each moment, and changes to the additional state would only affect those, without collection being rebuilt)

### Wrapping items with extra state

TODO

### Disabling or limiting cache

Passing `true` to `cacheInvalidation` prop in components that support it will disable caching altogether, but can
drastically reduce the performance for large number of components. In a test on a [Tree](../components/Tree) with 400 elements,
it was ~10x slower with cache being disabled.

A middle ground is to pass an array of cache invalidators instead of turning the cache off completely:

```tsx
<Tree cacheInvalidation={{ invalidators: [nestedSelection] }}>...</Tree>
```

This would invalidate the cache only when `nestedSelection` is changed.
